<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In the Core 1 course you have had a series of lectures about psychology as a science, and a series of RDA lectures that include experimental design and analysis. Both these lecture series complemented each other. Within these (among other things) you considered experimental design and variables, how to improve reproducibility, the purpose of replication in psychology, and controlling for extraneous variables in research studies.</p>
<p>This assessment will require you to utilise much of that knowledge to support you in designing and implementing your assessment task.</p>

<h3>Dual Lexical Decision Task (Meyer &amp; Schvaneveldt, 1971)</h3>
<p>Early cognitive behavioural studies showed that when participants were presented with pairs of words that were either related, unrelated or nonsense words (pseudowords), they responded faster and with better accuracy to the pairs of words that were related when compared with the unrelated pairs and the nonsense word pairs (Meyer and Schvaneveldt, 1971). </p>
<p>This is the task you will aim to replicate using PsychoPy Builder.  Read the starter reference provided to understand the aims and rationale for the task. There is an online demonstration of a Lexical Decision Task here which you can try to see how it works for yourself. 
<p>
<strong>Starter Reference:</strong> Meyer, D. E., & Schvaneveldt, R. W. (1971). Facilitation in recognizing pairs of words: Evidence of a dependence between retrieval operations. <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology, 90</em>, 227-234.</p>

  <h3>Assessment Requirements</h3>
<p>This course is designed to enhance knowledge developed with psychology as a science lectures and research methods within the core curriculum. This course will enable single-honours students to gain confidence in experimental research design and programming. These skills will be highly transferable to parts of the Level I course,  and within their dissertations at Level H.
<p>The course has been designed so that each week consists of a two-hour seminar. The sessions will progress through ideas about research scenarios and design and its application to use of programming within the discipline.  Following this, students will gain hands-on experience of programming in PsychoPy with use of peer-feedback to support understanding. Throughout the course, there will be a strong emphasis on effective peer support, problem solving and research collaboration.</p>
<p>Each week we  will provide the aims and learning outcomes relevant to the  session and to acheive this, some independent work is vital.  We also want to  stress  that every session  is  vital to  your assessment, as the  skills build week by week. If you miss anything  you will need to catch up in your own time.</p>
