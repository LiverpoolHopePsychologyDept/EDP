<h1>Understanding the Assessment</h1>
<p>In the Core 1 course you have had a series of lectures about psychology as a science, and a series of RDA lectures that include experimental design and analysis. Both these lecture series complemented each other. Within these (among other things) you considered experimental design and variables, how to improve reproducibility, the purpose of replication in psychology, and controlling for extraneous variables in research studies.</p>
<p>This assessment will require you to utilise much of that knowledge to support you in designing and implementing your assessment task.</p>
<p>Thecourse is designed to enhance knowledge developed with psychology as a science lectures and research methods within the core curriculum. This course will enable single-honours students to gain confidence in experimental research design and programming. These skills will be highly transferable to parts of the Level I course,  and within their dissertations at Level H.</p>
<h2>What we expect from you</h2>
<p><strong>Our expectation is that you attend all seminars, engage with the Activity Sets, and the EDP Forum.</strong></p>
<h2>What you can expect from us</h2>
<p>You can expect to have a two-hour seminar, some will utilise an activity to complete in class, and some will require independent and peer learning, such as the assessment support sessions. The seminars will progress through ideas about research scenarios and study design, and the application of programming within the discipline.  During this, students will gain hands-on experience of programming in PsychoPy guided by your expert tutors.</p><p><strong>Throughout the course, there will be a strong emphasis on effective peer support, problem solving and research collaboration.</strong></p>
<p>Each week we  will provide the aims and learning outcomes relevant to the  session and to acheive this, some independent work is vital.  We also want to  stress  that every session  is  vital to  your assessment, as the skills that you develop will build week by week. If you miss anything  you will need to catch up in your own time.</p>
