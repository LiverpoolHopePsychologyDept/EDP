<h3>Course Aims</h3>
<p>The overarching aims of this course are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>To help students understand the practical aspects of experimental research within discipline</li>
    <li>To  develop skills in programming experimental tasks in PsychoPy Builder using fundamental design principles</li>
    <li>Understand how to manage data from PsychoPy experiments</li>
	<li>To foster a sense of autonomy in the learning environment</li>
	</ul>
	
<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>By the end of the course students will:</p>
  <ul><li>Take responsibility for their own learning, identifying knowledge/skills gaps, and planning</li>
  <li>Have a working knowledge of how specialised software can be used to collect psychological data</li>
     <li>Communicate psychological knowledge accurately and reliably</li>
    <li>Understand the scientific method and be able to identify issues for research, and select appropriate methodological techniques to address these issues</li></ul>
<h3>Course Overview</h3>
<p>This course is designed to enhance knowledge developed with psychology as a science lectures and research methods within the core curriculum. This course will enable single-honours students to gain confidence in experimental research design and programming. These skills will be highly transferable to parts of the Level I course,  and within their dissertations at Level H.
<p>The course has been designed so that each week consists of a two-hour seminar. The sessions will progress through ideas about research scenarios and design and its application to use of programming within the discipline.  Following this, students will gain hands-on experience of programming in PsychoPy with use of peer-feedback to support understanding. Throughout the course, there will be a strong emphasis on effective peer support, problem solving and research collaboration.</p>
<p>Each week we  will provide the aims and learning outcomes relevant to the  session and to acheive this, some independent work is vital.  We also want to  stress  that every session  is  vital to  your assessment, as the  skills build week by week. If you miss anything  you will need to catch up in your own time.</p>
